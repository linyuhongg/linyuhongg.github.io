      <description>Following [1], we derive the gradient of different siamese self-supervised learning methods and show that although these methods appear to be quite different, they have similar gradient formulas. In particular, the gradient consists of three terms:
 A positive gradient, i.e., the representation of another augmented view from the same image, pulls positive samples together. A negative gradient, i.e., a weighted combination of the representations from different images, pushes negative samples apart.</description>
